### 3. Cost Analysis

#### Terraform Script
- **Setup Cost**: $0 (uses existing AWS Organizations)
- **Ongoing Cost**: $0 (no additional AWS services)
- **Resource Costs**: Only pay for resources used in created accounts
- **Total Cost**: Minimal operational overhead

#### AWS Control Tower
- **Setup Cost**: $0 (initial setup)
- **Ongoing Cost**: $3.50 per account per month
- **Resource Costs**: Additional costs for foundational services (CloudTrail, Config, etc.)
- **Total Cost**: Higher due to mandatory services and per-account fees

**Cost Example (10 accounts):**
- Terraform: ~$0/month
- Control Tower: ~$35/month + additional service costs

### 4. Implementation Complexity

#### Terraform Script
**Setup Steps:**
1. Configure environment variables
2. Run `terraform plan`
3. Run `terraform apply`
4. Verify account creation

**Time to Deploy:** 5-10 minutes per account

#### AWS Control Tower
**Setup Steps:**
1. Initial Control Tower setup (1-2 hours)
2. Configure account factory
3. Set up customizations (if needed)
4. Create accounts through account factory

**Time to Deploy:** 30-60 minutes initial setup, 10-15 minutes per account

### 5. Customization and Flexibility

#### Terraform Script
**High Flexibility:**
- Custom account configurations
- Integration with any CI/CD pipeline
- Custom tagging strategies
- Integration with external systems
- Multi-cloud capabilities
- Custom security implementations

#### AWS Control Tower
**Limited Flexibility:**
- Standardized account configurations
- Limited customization options
- AWS-native integrations only
- Predefined security baselines
- Account Factory for Terraform (AFT) provides more flexibility but adds complexity

## Decision Matrix

### Choose Terraform Script When:

✅ **Simple Requirements**: You need basic account creation without complex governance
✅ **Cost Sensitivity**: Budget constraints make Control Tower fees prohibitive
✅ **Existing Setup**: You already have a well-established AWS Organizations structure
✅ **Custom Needs**: You require specific customizations not available in Control Tower
✅ **Multi-Cloud**: You need to manage accounts across multiple cloud providers
✅ **Small Scale**: Managing fewer than 20-30 accounts
✅ **Team Expertise**: Your team has strong Terraform and AWS expertise

### Choose AWS Control Tower When:
